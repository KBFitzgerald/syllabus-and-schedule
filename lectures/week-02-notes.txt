Always use complete sentences and proper punctuation.

Use Python 3.

Turn your completed notebook (.ipynb) files in to Blackboard.

Commit your notebook (.ipynb) to GitHub.

Your current working directory ("Downloads", etc.) is not necessarily
the same as mine.  Your executed cell count is not the same as mine.

In future notebooks we'll make a point to keep long output to a minimum.

Good answers:

"The use of the capital 'F' means that the contents of the current
directory will be shown in a sorted order, and directories will be
marked with a trailing '/'. The lower-case 'f' means the contents
will be displayed without marking directories and will be unsorted.
The single dot '.' references the current directory."

"The double dots are a shortcut to refer to the parent directory.
In this case, the double dots, used with 'ls', show the contents
of the parent directory."

"The double dot is the directory above the current working directory.
In my case, it is '/home/vagrant/Data Warehousing'."


Reproducible research - Roger Peng videos

Replication - important but expensive and unique
Reproducible - data/code available to reproduce methods
  bridges gap between replication and nothing
  confirm findings from same inputs, analysis

Research pipeline, article == homework assignment / project
  use pipeline image?
  
Analytic data, code available w/documentation
  raw data might not be practical or even used

Literate programming - notebooks
  human and machine readable
